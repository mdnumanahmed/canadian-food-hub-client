              Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma
              software so everything you see in the library has a design
              equivalent in our Figma file.

              The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are
              open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid
              product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller and
              standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of
              pages.

              However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro,
